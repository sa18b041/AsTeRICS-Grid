## Documentation
see [User documentation](docs/documentation_user/README.md) or [AsTeRICS Grid Playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0UXHkT03dGrIHldlEKR0ZWfNMkShuTNz).

## Run project locally
1. clone the project `git clone git@github.com:asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid.git`
2. install node.js https://nodejs.org/
3. install yarn, see https://yarnpkg.com/
4. go to the directory of the cloned project and run `yarn install`
5. run `npm run start` and open http://localhost:9095

## Npm scripts
After `yarn install` the following commands are available:
1. `npm run start` --> starts a webserver serving the AsTeRICS grid on `http://localhost:9095`, does hot reloading if js-sources change.
2. `npm run build` --> builds the js-files in folder `src` to `app/build` and `app/build_legacy` folders.
3. `npm run start-superlogin-dev` --> runs [superlogin](https://github.com/colinskow/superlogin) locally and makes it possible to create "online users" within the locally running application. A local [CouchDb](https://couchdb.apache.org/) instance is necessary in order to work.
4. `npm run release` -> releases the current version with a new tag and push it to `gh-pages` branch in order to be served at https://grid.asterics.eu/
5. `npm run release-latest` -> same as `npm run release` but with destination https://grid.asterics.eu/latest/

## History
The AsTeRICS Grid evolved out of [AsTeRICS Ergo](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Ergo), see [AsTeRICS Ergo Master Plan](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Ergo/wiki/Master-Plan-AsTeRICS-Ergo) and [AsTeRICS Ergo Architecture](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Ergo/wiki/Architecture) and will eventually replace AsTeRICS Ergo.
